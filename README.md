# R_SQL_HO_Deductible
This was an ad-hoc project to analyze the Home Deductible trends for the past 10 years

The SQL script is to get the data for each of the past 10 years and combine them. The final result is saved in a table in server.
The R script is to analyze the results. It finally output graphs and figures in an Excel workbook to report to management.

There might be repetitive codes to create graphs but this was done on purpose due to:
- the need to have the analysis ready asap and this might be a one-time analysis only
- there are variations among the categories, thus it would be faster to be able to twist the codes to make the graphs look good when outputting
